The instruction for postmortem (fixed) image transformation
- two methods: image transformation & centroid transformation


A. Find anchor cells manually:
Image J> File> Import> Image sequence> import in vivo and fixed images.
Analyze> Measure> use point selection tool to click on the identified cell> Ctrl M to save the coordinate.
% a sameple of anchor cells is in the mat file in the folder. Step A can be skipped.

B. Image Transformation (affine):
>> read_stack   % load the in vivo image stack (256*256)
>> vivo=b;
>> read_stack   % load the fixed image stack (256*256)
>> fixed=b;
Load anchors   % from the mat file in the folder.
>> realign_fix_to_vivo
>> QQ=[vivo, fixed_aligned];
>> write_stack   % create a folder and save images.



Part C requires the in vivo and fixed image stacks (512*512). Please contact Dr. Kenichi Ohki.
C-0. Find centroids of cells:
>> findcell3D 
% select image source (ex. in vivo images 512*512)> enter frame range> create a folder for saving.
% the output contains two parts. The first is a set of binary images in which cells are represented by 1s. 
  The second is a 3D distribution of the found cells represented by their centroids. Save the centroids of the in vivo cells as centroidsv. 
% Repeat the process in the fixed images. Save the centroids of the fixed cells as centroidsf.
% frame range should be bigger than 20 frames; otherwise no cell will be detected due to boarder canceling.

 
C-1. Cenroid transformation (affine):
>> clear all; 
Load centroids   % from the mat file in the folder.
Load anchors   % from mat file in the folder.
>> findcell3D_transformation_plot    
% the output contains two figures. One is the 3D distribution of in vivo cells represented by their centroids. 
  The other is the 3D distribution of affine transformed fixed cells represented by their centroids.
% green dots are the anchors.

Color labeling of surrounding cells in the in vivo figure:
Use data cursor to click on the cell of interest.
>> surrounding_vivo2    
% in the input dialog, enter the coordinate of the cell and the radius for labeling. 
  Cells whose x, y, and z are all smaller than the radius will be labeled.

Color labeling of surrounding cells in the fixed_affined figure:
Use data cursor to click on the cell of interest
>> surrounding_fixed_tformed
% in the input dialog, enter the coordinate of the cell and the radius for labeling. 
  Cells whose x, y, and z are all smaller than the radius will be labeled.


C-2. Cenroid transformation (affine + nonlinear CPD):
>> clear all; 
Load centroids   % from the mat file in the folder.
Load anchors   % from the mat file in the folder.
>> affine_cpd_plot    
% the output contains three figures. The second is the 3D distribution of in vivo cells represented by their centroids. 
  The third is the 3D distribution of affine+CPD transformed fixed cells represented by their centroids. Ignore the first one.
% green dots are the anchors.

Color labeling of surrounding cells in the in vivo figure:
Use data cursor to click on the cell of interest
>> surrounding_vivo2
% in the input dialog, enter the coordinate of the cell and the radius for labeling. 
  Cells whose x, y, and z are all smaller than the radius will be labeled.

Color labeling of surrounding cells in the fixed_affined_CPDed figure:
Use data cursor to click on the cell of interest
>> surrounding_fixed_tformed_CPDed
% in the input dialog, enter the coordinate of the cell and the radius for labeling. 
  Cells whose x, y, and z are all smaller than the radius will be labeled.
