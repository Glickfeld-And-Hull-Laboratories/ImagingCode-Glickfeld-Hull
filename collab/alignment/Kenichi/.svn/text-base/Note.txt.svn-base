Notes for image transformation

1. Postmortem and in vivo image stacks have the same size: 256*256*60 in pixels, or 154*154*60 in £gm.
2. Corresponding cells from the in vivo and postmortem image stacks are hand-picked, and the coordinates of their centroids are listed in 4-by-N matrices 
   [in vivo] and [postmortem], respectively. The first three rows are the coordinates and the 4th rows are ones. Four pairs of cells are required to solve 
   the affine matrix for a 3-dimensional transformation. In this example, we picked 41 pairs of corresponding cells and [in vivo] and [postmortem] are 
   4-by-41 matrices. 
3. The affine matrix for transforming the in vivo image stack to the postmortem image stack is obtained by solving: Mvp* [in vivo]= [postmortem].
4. A new image space with a size 256*256*60 is allocated. [1, 1, 1] is operated by Mvp (Mvp* [1, 1, 1]) and the resulted coordinate is rounded to integer. 
   The pixel value of the same position (rounded Mvp* [1, 1, 1]) in the postmortem image stack is ¡§fished¡¨ and assigned to the position [1, 1, 1] in the 
   new space. If Mvp* [x, y, z] falls off the range of the postmortem image stack, a pixel value of zero is assigned to [x, y, z]. By repeating this process 
   from [1, 1, 1] to [256, 256, 60], the postmortem image stack is realigned to the new image space. In short, a new image space (256*256*60) is 
   transformed by Mvp and mapped to the postmortem image stack. This transformed image space will take up the pixel values it encounters in the postmortem 
   image stack and then be transformed backed to a cubic space. 
5. The in vivo image stack is displayed along its z axis in the movie on left-hand side. The realigned postmortem image stack is displayed along its z axis 
   in the movie on the right-hand side. The realigned postmortem movie should correspond to the in vivo movie.
