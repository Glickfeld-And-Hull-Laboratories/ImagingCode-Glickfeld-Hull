# Duke-Neurobiology-Retreat-2024
This repository contains code to re-make the figures from my poster for the Duke Neurobiology Retreat held in September of 2024. The outcome is slightly altered because several days of data were added since the time I made the poster. Figure 8 was most dramatically different, and some slightly different analysis is present in the Resposity Most-Recent-Analysis that recaptures some of the original effect.

First run NavigateLoadData.m to load the data. I think I commented out all the save commands (FigureWrap) but it may be wise to go to a fresh folder.
Scripts for the other figures should then be run as desired. Simply copy and paste into the command line or hightlight all and run. Parameters that may be adjusted like binsize, smoothing, and thresholds are set at the top of the script (or in blocks later on if there is more than one analysis per script).
