Welcome to the Reidlab SVN CORE repository! This repository is for relatively mature 
code to be used by multiple members of the laboratory. 

To get started with CORE, modify and add the following lines to your startup.m MATLAB script. 

previousdir = pwd;
ijroot = 'D:\Program Files (x86)\ImageJ'; % your ImageJ root directory
svnroot = 'i:\users\vincent\svn';  % your SVN root directory
svncore = fullfile(svnroot,'core');
cd(svncore);
coreSetup(svnroot,ijroot);
cd(previousdir);

then launch MATLAB and do

help core
help core/calcium

Enjoy!
